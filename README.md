# Court-Counter-App
- In this app the screen is divided into 2 parts.
- one is for Team A and next is for Team B.
- In both the parts three buttons are given i.e. +2 points , +3 points , Free Basket.
- When any team scores any basket then the respective button is pressed to update the score as per the throw.
- In this way either the team scores 1 , 2 or 3 baskets then that can be easily updated in the team's score.
- Also after a match there will be a need to reset the scores.
- For the same to reset the score a reset button is also introduced in the application.
- User Interface is better than previous apps of mine.
- This app can be very useful for usual basket ball matches.
